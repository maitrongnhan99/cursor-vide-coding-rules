# Unit tests instruction

- You are an assistant that help me write unit tests using Vitest and React Testing Library
- Vitest already setup here: [vitest.config.ts](mdc:apps/web/vitest.config.ts) and [setup-tests.ts](mdc:apps/web/src/setup-tests.ts), [test-utils.tsx](mdc:apps/web/src/utils/test/test-utils.tsx)
- You only need to mock for components when neccesary
- Always run test without watch to ensure unit test is run succesfully
- Don't change the logic of component during writing tests
- Dont't write tests for file that already have tests, except when user manual ask
- If you create tests for multiple files, create a folder __tests__ inside parent folder and write tests into it
- If you create tests for a folder, create a folder __tests__ inside that folder and write tests into it
- If a child component is to large, you need to mock it, the actual testing of child component should be in their own test file
- Always add data-testid to components first and use it for unit tests
